To handle multiple games running at once  I implemented my code with 
multitple threads so that it can handle multiple games at once by assigning 
each game to its own thread. In the serve_game() function, new client 
connections are accepted and stored in the waiting_clients list. When two clients are 
available, they are popped off the list and a new thread is started using 
threading.Thread(target=handle_game, args=(p1, p2), daemon=True).start(). This 
launches the handle_game() function in a separate thread, allowing the main server
loop to continue accepting new clients without preventing new clients from joining. 
As a result, many games can be run simultaneously with many clients.
